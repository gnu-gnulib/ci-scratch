  /* What do the results look like?
     * On Alpine Linux, Cygwin, Android, the output is empty.
     * The entries are usually not sorted according to the Time column, so
       we do it here.
     * In the User column, special values exist:
       - The empty string denotes a system event.
         Seen on glibc, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, AIX
       - The value "reboot" denotes a reboot.
         Seen on glibc
       - The value "runlevel" denotes a runlevel change.
         Seen on glibc
       - The value "LOGIN" denotes the start of a virtual console.
         Seen on glibc, Solaris
       - The value "/usr/libexec/getty" denotes the start of a virtual console.
         Seen on NetBSD
     * In the Device column:
       - The empty string denotes a system event.
         Seen on macOS, FreeBSD, AIX
       - The value "~" denotes an event with no associated device.
         Seen on glibc
       - The values "system boot", "system down", "run-level N" are
         seen on NetBSD, AIX, Solaris.
       - The values "old time", "new time" are
         seen on Solaris.
       - Common devices are:
         - On glibc: "ttyN" (console) and "pts/N" (pseudo-terminals).
         - On macOS: "ttysNNN" (pseudo-terminals).
         - On FreeBSD: "ttyvN" (console).
         - On NetBSD: "ttyEN", "constty" (console).
         - On OpenBSD: "ttyCN", "console" (console) and "ttypN" (pseudo-terminals).
         - on AIX: "vtyN" (console) and "pts/N" (pseudo-terminals).
         - On Solaris: "vt/N", "console" (console) and "pts/N" (pseudo-terminals).
     * The PID column is zero on platforms without a 'ut_pid' field: OpenBSD.
