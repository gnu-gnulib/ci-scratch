.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-\-backup\fR[=\fI\,CONTROL\/\fR]
make a backup of each existing destination file
.TP
\fB\-b\fR
like \fB\-\-backup\fR but does not accept an argument
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
explain how a file is copied.  Implies \fB\-v\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-exchange\fR
exchange source and destination
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
do not prompt before overwriting
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
prompt before overwrite
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-clobber\fR
do not overwrite an existing file
.PP
If you specify more than one of \fB\-i\fR, \fB\-f\fR, \fB\-n\fR, only the final one takes effect.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-copy\fR
do not copy if renaming fails
.TP
\fB\-\-strip\-trailing\-slashes\fR
remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE
argument
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-suffix\fR=\fI\,SUFFIX\/\fR
override the usual backup suffix
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-target\-directory\fR=\fI\,DIRECTORY\/\fR
move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-no\-target\-directory\fR
treat DEST as a normal file
.TP
\fB\-\-update\fR[=\fI\,UPDATE\/\fR]
control which existing files are updated;
UPDATE={all,none,none\-fail,older(default)}
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
equivalent to \fB\-\-update\fR[=\fI\,older\/\fR].  See below
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
explain what is being done
.TP
\fB\-Z\fR, \fB\-\-context\fR
set SELinux security context of destination
file to default type
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
UPDATE controls which existing files in the destination are replaced.
\&'all' is the default operation when an \fB\-\-update\fR option is not specified,
and results in all existing files in the destination being replaced.
\&'none' is like the \fB\-\-no\-clobber\fR option, in that no files in the
destination are replaced, and skipped files do not induce a failure.
\&'none\-fail' also ensures no files are replaced in the destination,
but any skipped files are diagnosed and induce a failure.
\&'older' is the default operation when \fB\-\-update\fR is specified, and results
in files being replaced if they're older than the corresponding source file.
.PP
The backup suffix is '~', unless set with \fB\-\-suffix\fR or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.
The version control method may be selected via the \fB\-\-backup\fR option or through
the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:
.TP
none, off
never make backups (even if \fB\-\-backup\fR is given)
.TP
numbered, t
make numbered backups
.TP
existing, nil
numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
.TP
simple, never
always make simple backups
